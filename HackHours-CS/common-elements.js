/*

Write a function called commonElements that takes in any number of arrays in the 
argument. The arrays may contain both numbers and strings. It should return a new array
with all the common elements (both numbers and/or strings) from the given input. 
If there are no common numbers/strings, return "Nothing in Common!"
Assume there are no duplicates within the array.


ex: 
arr1 = [2, 10,'cat', 3, 99, 2000, 'dog', 'lion'];
arr2 = [3, 7, 2, 2000, 1, 'dog', 'cat'];
arr3 = [2, 100, 2000, 'dog', 3, 'lion'];

commonElements(arr1, arr2, arr3) -> [2, 3, 2000, 'dog']
