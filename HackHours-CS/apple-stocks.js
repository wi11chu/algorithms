/*

Consider an array called apple-stock as an argument. This array 
represents the variation of an Apple stock during a single day. 
The values in the array are in chronological order.

ex: [1000, 500, 1500, 2000, 0] --> The stock began at 1000 and closed at 0;

Write a function called highestProfit that calculates the highest profit 
you can make in the given day by buying and selling a single Apple stock. 
This is comprised of one buy and one sell. Keep your worst case 
time complexity in O(n^2).

Return 0 if no profit is possible OR if input is invalid.

** Extension **
Refactor your function to improve your time complexity to O(n).
Hint: Use pointers to keep track of the indices of max, min to 
calculate profit along the array.
