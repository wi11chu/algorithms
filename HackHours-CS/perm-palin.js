/**
 * Given a string, determine if any of the permutations of that string is a palindrome
 * @see: Permutations: https://stattrek.com/statistics/dictionary.aspx?definition=permutation
 * @see: Palindromes: https://examples.yourdictionary.com/palindrome-examples.html
 *
 * In terms of time complexity, see if you can solve this in O(n) / linear time.
 * 
 * Example:
 * 	- permPalin('abab') => true
 * 	- permPalin('cbaba') => true
 * 	- permPalin('cbac') => false
 * 	- permPalin('a') => true
 *
 * Hint: Think about the length of the string and how that relates to the frequencies of the characters
